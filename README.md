# Real-time-Face-mask-detector
In this time of the pandemic, wearing masks is mandatory. So I came up with an idea. An idea about making a real-time mask detection model using Python and ML. Eventually, this became my topic for the Artificial Intelligence project in college.

So without any further delay, let's dive right into it!

# Hardware Requirements:

1. Quad-core processor(Intel/AMD) or higher

2. Dedicated NVIDIA GPU(Mx 250M or higher/GTX 750 Ti or higher)

3. 8GB 2333MHz RAM or higher

# Software Requirements:

Be very careful while installing all the required software, as incompatible software versions will cause conflicts in the upcoming steps. Install these ones one by one:

1. Anaconda - https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual

2. Python 3.8 - https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380/

3. Visual Studio - https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/

4. CUDA Toolkit - https://developer.nvidia.com/Cuda-Toolkit-Archive

5. CuDNN - https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-download

# Follow these steps to install CuDNN:

1. Download the latest cuDNN for CUDA 11.1

2. Download the library for Windows 10

3. Extract the contents of the zip file (i.e. the folder named cuda) inside <INSTALL_PATH>\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.1\, where <INSTALL_PATH> points to the installation directory specified during the installation of the CUDA Toolkit. By default <INSTALL_PATH> = C:\Program Files
