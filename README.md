# Real-time-Face-mask-detector
In this time of the pandemic, wearing masks is mandatory. So I came up with an idea. An idea about making a real-time mask detection model using Python and ML. Eventually, this became my topic for the Artificial Intelligence project in college.

So without any further delay, let's dive right into it!

# Hardware Requirements:

Quad-core processor(Intel/AMD) or higher
